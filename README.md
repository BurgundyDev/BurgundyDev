🎮 I love making games and letting wide audiances experience them.

🧑‍💻 I specialize in C++, but I know my fair share of Python, Java and C#.

🖼️ I'm most interested in rendering systems and APIs.

🦀 My friends and I make games (mostly for Jams) as CrabsInGames. Don't hesitate to check us out at https://github.com/CrabsInGames/!

✏️ Currently working on my own minimalist C++ game dev framework.
